    <h2>A Brief history about my coding journey</h2>
    <p>I officially started this journey just over a seven years ago, i had one language in mind to begin with that was python.I found that it was more than just learning the Python language (apparently one of the easiest ones to learn), it was also changing the way you think about and approach problems.</p>
    <p>As for me i have specialized in Data science. I have helped individulas on how to be the best python developers.Last year i managed geting a job in sigma data science Company.</p>
    <p>Through the journey still i have learned different types of languages.</p>
    <h3>I have learnt the following languages;</h3>
